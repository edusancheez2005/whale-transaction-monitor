1) focus on really trying to get a good prediction on wether it is a sell 
    or a buy. Maybe start developing an algorithm for this, and then, integrate
    it by showing all of the transfers that are made.

Structure:
- Right now, we get ALL of the transactions, we get A LOT
- However, we are not too sure about the probability of wether it is a buy or a sell
- We are just using a classification system on wether they are from an KNOWN exchange address and stuff.
